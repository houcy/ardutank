# Ardutank ðŸš—
Another Arduino based rover. I done this simple project for a friend while I was at the first year of high school.
It's really bad coded, don't judge me. ðŸ™ˆ
Also is heavily commented since my friend needed comments in order to understand what was going on through the code.
I've lost schematics and the bill of materials but you can guess those watching the photos in the gallery folder.
